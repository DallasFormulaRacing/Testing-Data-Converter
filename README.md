## Added full support for putting EVERY channel from our CAN Bus files into a MoTec I2 pro file, with support for units and frequency.
#### This project processes brake and steering data to be usable in MoTec I2. It will also prune channels: filters out null data points and those that are recorded within 10 milliseconds of each other to reduce the data density and speed up processing. And, it will interpolate the channels to keep a regular frequency. 
#### If we can, I think we should remove a lot of the channels included that weren't in Reid's original list because they seem useless. 
#### This code is ugly, but it should be readable.
