# Testing-Data-Converter
### Converter from csv / canbus formats into support for multiple racing data formats.

#### NOTE: The way I wrote my channel processing for steering angle, throttle position, etc. is based on the assumption that sensor data will come paired with time, like how it is when I download it from Arjun's Grafana.
#### It shouldn't be hard to change that to fit the format data will actually come in.
